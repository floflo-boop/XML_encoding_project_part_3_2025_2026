# Reflection about my learning process 

Throughout this course, especially during the three phases of the encoding project, my learning process has been quite varied.

I already had some basic knowledge of XML from a class last year, which provided a foundation. However, I quickly realized that this was nothing compared to the vast XML ecosystem and all the possibilities it offers.
This was actually my first major challenge. 

As we saw during the DTD encoding phase, XML is incredibly permissive, diverse, and flexible. It demands creativity—or at least decision-making—for almost every line of encoding. I struggled a lot with this flexibility and the open-ended nature of XML. While learning XML commands wasn’t particularly difficult, managing an XML project on my own was much more complex. Choosing the right sources, the best encoding approach for specific objectives, and so on was challenging. But it was also incredibly rewarding!

The TEI phase didn’t pose any major problems for me, except that my sources weren’t always easy to encode using the TEI_ALL schema. However, I found this part easier because it provided a more structured environment with less flexibility—which suits me better.

When we moved on to creating custom ODD files and using Schematron, things became more complicated. I still have some difficulties understanding how everything works, so the third phase was much more challenging for me. But it was also a great learning experience!


In the end, I think this work not only improved my XML encoding skills but also strengthened my ability to work independently in a highly permissive environment. It taught me how to set my own goals, create structure, and build an environment tailored to my tasks.

Thank you again for the course!
